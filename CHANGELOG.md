### Patch Changes

- ba5947b3: We moved the options menu to the left so that they're easier to access. Later this will be the entry point for re-ordering rows (similar to notion)
  Fixed an issue where the selected state of a row wasn't displayed correctly
  Moved the ability to open a token sidesheet away from clicking on the token name and instead moved that to its own entry point to the right of the name cell that appears on hover
  Introduced rich display of typography tokens in the table view
  Checkboxes to select rows are now displayed on hover on top of the row index
  Adjusted various token type icons in the table
  The whole table header is now clickable to sort that column
  Fixed various table cells to have proper styling when jumping into edit mode
  Optimized Token flow's entry point
